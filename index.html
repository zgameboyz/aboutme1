        <h2><u>Short Bio</u></h2>
        <p>Hello World! My name is Qaalid Hashi (he/him), but I go by Q mostly, and I am 24 years old. I've held a variety of jobs, but I've mostly worked in Security. I have gone to college but I've ended changing my focus to IT. From glowing recommendations from friends and family, I decided to go through Code Fellows to pursue a new future. My goals for the future are pretty barebones at the moment, so my current goal is that <u>I want to graduate from Code Fellows with the skills and connections needed to launch my career.</u></p>
